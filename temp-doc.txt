5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?
We ask to search in the parent folder all the files that start with “temp-“ to copy them in the current folder
5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?
Because it is already a git repository, we use “git clone” and the url of the repository so it is already categorized as a git 
5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.
Maybe with  “git commit * -m "initial commit" but it didn’t work.
